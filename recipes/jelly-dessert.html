            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A super easy and simple dessert that you can prepare for any occasion and that only needs three ingredients.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 sachet of gelatin of your favorite flavor</li>
                <li> 1 cup of water</li>
                <li>2 cups evaporated milk</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Before starting, it is recommended to put the can of evaporated milk in the freezer for at least one hour. This will help you get a frothier texture when preparing the jelly.</li>
                <li>First, pour the cup of water in a saucepan and bring it to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once it boils, add the powdered gelatin and stir constantly with a spoon to dissolve it well and avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Next, take the evaporated milk out of the refrigerator, pour it into a bowl and start beating it with a whisk until you see it starts to foam. You can do the same with a hand whisk, the only difference is that it will take longer to get the desired texture. If you do not have either, you can also make the gelatin with evaporated milk in a blender.</li>
                <li>Add the gelatin dissolved in the evaporated milk. Do it little by little and keep whisking. Continue beating until you get a frothy texture, it will be like a gelatin mousse with evaporated milk!</li>
                <li>Once it has a foamy texture, pour the mixture into a mold or individual molds and put it in the refrigerator. Leave it in the refrigerator for a minimum of 3 to 4 hours to set. </li>
            </ol>
